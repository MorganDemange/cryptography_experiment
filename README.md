This repository contains the implementation of some of the most classical cryptography algorithms:

    Symmetric/Private-key cryptography: One-Time-Pad (OTP), Rivest Cipher 4 (RC4), Data Encryption Standard (DES), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).
    Asymmetric/Public-key cryptography: RSA, Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) + ECC Digital Signatures (ECDSA).
    Hashing functions: MD5, SHA-256.
    Some pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs).

The GNU MP library (https://gmplib.org/) is required; you can download and compile your own version or use the one that I've already compiled and included in the repository (version 6.3.0).

IMPORTANT NOTE !!! : do not use this code for real applications, it is absolutely not secure. It was made for learning and experiment purposes only.
